# profanity-validator

A lightweight SDK for profanity filtering in forms. This library is designed to prevent bad word spam by validating user input and throwing errors if profanity is detected. Built to be flexible, it can be integrated easily into any HTML or JavaScript framework, including React, Next.js, and many more.

## Features

- **Profanity Filtering:** Automatically detects and validates user input against a predefined list of profane words.
- **Customizable:** Allows users to add their own custom profanity words to the validation.
- **Framework Agnostic:** Works seamlessly across different frameworks and libraries.
- **Error Handling:** Throws validation errors instead of replacing profanity words, preventing form submission.
- **Asynchronous Validation:** Uses an internal API [(profanity.dev)](https://www.profanity.dev/) to check for profanity, Built by [Josh](https://github.com/joschan21) .

## Installation

You can install the SDK via any nodejs package manager:

```bash
npm install profanity-validator
pnpm add profanity-validator
bun add profanity-validator
yarn add profanity-validator
```
